# Haranalysis
The aim of this work is the development of a complete system for the collection, management, and analysis of crowdsourced information regarding HTTP traffic data.

The analysis of HAR (HTTP Archive) files from multiple computers, involving various websites and different access times, has the potential to reveal particularly interesting aspects of the infrastructure of the World Wide Web. Therefore, the purpose of the work is to construct a system for the collective collection of HAR data aimed at providing some basic analyses for each user separately, as well as more general analyses concerning internet infrastructure in an area.
